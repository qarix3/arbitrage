Overall Inventory Turnover Ratio =
Cost of goods sold / Average total inventories at cost

Raw Material Inventory Turnover Ratio
= Annual consumption of raw material / Average raw material inventory

Work-in-process Inventory Turnover Ratio =
Cost of manufacture / Average work in process inventory at cost

Finished Goods Inventory Turnover ratio =
Cost of goods sold / Average inventory of finished goods at cost

Average Age of Raw Materials in Inventory =
Average Raw Material Inventory at cost / Average Daily Purchase of Raw Materials

Average Age of Finished Goods Inventory =
Average finished goods inventory at Cost / Average cost of goods manufactured per day

Out-of-stock Index = Number of times out of stock / Number of times requisitioned

Spare Parts Index = Value of Spare Parts Inventory / Value of Capital Eeuipment
